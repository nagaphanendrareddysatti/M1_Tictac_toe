# TICTACTOE
  # INTRODUCTION:
  Tic-Tac-Toe game [1] can be played by two players where the square block (3 x 3) can be filled with a cross (X) or a circle (O). The game will toggle between the players by giving the chance
for each player to mark their move. When one of the players make a combination of 3 same markers in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line the program will display which player has won,
whether X or O.The Tic-Tac-Toe game is most familiar among all the age groups. The friendliness of Tic-tac-toe games makes them ideal as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship. The
game is a very good brain exercise. It involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.
  # Research
  # Advantages:
      * improve hand-eye coordination and encourage better social interaction by better collaborative play
      * Play systems have incorporated alphabet panels and tic-tac-toe panels to help children improve their concentration.
      * efficient in time
      * optimal in theory
  # Disadvantages:
      * lots of space (too much?)
      * Someone has to specify all the 3^9 entries (19683 entries)
      * errors in specifying all 3^9 entries easy to make
      * Extensibility? (3 dim 3^{27} movetable entries, 4x4....)
  # Cost and Features:
      * EasierAccess
      * Cost free
  # TimeLine:
      * Problem Statement ---> Research ---> Plan --->Design --->Implement--->Execute.
  # Defining our System:
      * a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os
        before the opponent does.
      * Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.In the following example, the first player (X) wins 
        the game in seven steps.
  # ARCHITECTURE:
      * This gaming architecture is to be played between two people. Here, one of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other as ‘X’ to mark the respective cells.
      * Here, the game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row or column with respective character.
      * If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw. The moves taken by the computer and human are chosen randomly.
  # TOOLS USED:
      * GCC Compiler
      * C/C++ interpreter Ch 5.0
  # OBJECTIVE:
      * The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. An opponent can prevent a win by blocking
        the completion of the opponent's line.
  # STEPS:
      * The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
      * You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
      * The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
      * When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
  # Requirements:
      * The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
      * You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
      * The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
      * When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
