# Abstract
Tic-Tac-Toe game can be played by two players where the square block (3 x 3) can be filled with a cross (X) or a circle (O). The game will toggle between the players by giving the chance for each player to mark their move. When one of the players make a combination of 3 same markers in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line the program will display which player has won, whether X or O. In this paper, we implement a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game in LabVIEW. The game is designed so that two players can play tic-tac-toe using LabVIEW software. The program will contain a display function and a select function to place the symbol as well as toggle between the symbols allowing each player a turn to play the game. The program will update after each player makes their move and check for the conditions of game as it goes on. Overall program works without any bugs and is able to use.
